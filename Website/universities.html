                <p>Harvard University is the best school in the US according to the USA rankings 2021. Founded in 1636, Harvard University is the oldest institute of higher learning in the US and is currently home to 23,731 students. Like MIT, Harvard is in Cambridge, but close enough for students to pop across the river to explore the culture and nightlife of Boston.</p>
                <p>Despite tuition fees being among the highest on the globe, over 55 percent of Harvard University undergraduates receive a financial aid scholarship. An impressive 98 percent of all Harvard undergraduate students choose to live on campus for the full duration of their four years, meaning the Harvard experience is a very immersive one.  </p>

            <div>
                <p>Located on 168 acres of land in Cambridge, facing Boston across the Charles River, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is the third best school in the US, according to the most recent USA rankings. MIT’s enrolment totals just over 11,500 students, of which 6,990 are postgraduates. Admission is highly competitive, with less than 10 percent of applications accepted each year. </p> 
                <p>MIT has a strong focus on science and technology subjects, and innovation and leadership . However, despite its name and main focus areas, MIT in fact covers a broad range of subjects. Its Sloan School of Management is internationally renowned, while more than half of undergraduates take at least one arts course.    </p>

            <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu"><h2>Northeastern University</h2></a>
            <div class="style-img university3"></div>
            <div>
            <p>An experiential research institution, Northeastern University is focused on global and contemporary world issues. There are currently 20,400 undergraduates and 17,379 postgraduate students at the school. </p> 
            <p>Ranked 49th in the US, Northeastern is one of few universities in Boston to have its main campus within the city centre. Located in an area beside the Museum of Fine Arts and Symphony Hall, Northeastern is very much an urban university, but is also surrounded by trees and grassy areas. It also has a strong focus on community, since 2006 students have been involved in completing over one million hours of community service.   </p>
